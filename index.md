## Intro

Hello my name is Elise Harrell. I am a senior in computer science, expected to graduate in 2025 at Simmons University.

I am incredibly interested in data and machine learning, specifically data cleaning and preprocessing. I worked as an intern at ICAT, creating a machine learning project to research insurance claim expenses.

My experiences include machine learning and AI in Python and R. As well as software engineering and game enginerring in Python, Java and C#.

I am using this sight for showcaseing the work I did during my Data Science Class, as we did many assignments, and a final project.

## Final Project: Student Habit's can predict Exam Scores

This is my final project for my Data Science class in which I analyze a Kaggle Data set of student's habits, mental health and exam scores. And create a model to predict exam scores from their mental health and habits.
